Description:
		If CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL is enabled, the kernel can be
		moved to a more locked down state at runtime by writing to
		this attribute. Valid values are:

		integrity:
			The kernel will disable functionality that allows
			userland to modify the running kernel image, other
			than through the loading or execution of appropriately
			signed objects.

		confidentiality:
			The kernel will disable all functionality disabled by
			the integrity mode, but additionally will disable
			features that potentially permit userland to obtain
			confidential information stored within the kernel.
